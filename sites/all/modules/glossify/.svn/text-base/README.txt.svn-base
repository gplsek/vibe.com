glossify.module
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


How it works
-----------

You have:
1. "Link-FROM" content types - We look for keywords into their text and replace them with links.
2. "Link-TO" content types. (node-title = keyword).
3. Glossify auto links from 1 to 2 using the settings you specify at admin/settings/glossify.

-- See the http://drupal.org/project/glossify page for an up to date and detailed intro.
-- See http://segments.at/documentation-for-glossify-internal-links-auto for the whole docs.
