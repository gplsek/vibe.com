Views Display Tabs
------------------

Views Display Tabs exposes a view's displays as links which you can then style
as tabs if you so choose.

The module requires an AJAX-capable browser. There's no fallback or graceful
degradation for non-AJAX-capable browser at this point.

How to install and use
----------------------

   1. Download the module, extract it, then copy it your modules directory and
      enable it.
   2. Go to admin/settings/viewsdisplaytabs. You will see a list of views that
      have AJAX enabled. If there are no views in the list, make sure there's
      at least one view that has AJAX enabled. See the instructions on the
      settings page for more information.
   3. Check the module you want to enable display tabs for and check the
      displays you want to show as tabs. Choose whether you want the tabs to show
      a throbber (loading animation) while the view is loading.
   4. Your view's header will now contain the displays as item lists. You may
      theme these lists as tabs if you so choose. Clicking a display's link will
      update the view and replace the current display with the one you clicked.
      This only works with AJAX at the moment (no graceful degradation for
      browsers with poor JavaScript support).

NOTE: If your view uses exposed filters and you want these to show regardless
of what tab is selected you have to add these filters to every display.


REQUIREMENTS
In order to use this module you will need at least one view which has AJAX
enabled. The view must have at least two displays that render as HTML. Displays
of type Block or Page render as HTML. These will become the tabs the user can
click. Follows is an explanation of the configuration settings at
admin/settings/viewsdisplaytabs
